<h3 align="center">Elegant C++ playground for sorting algorithms and data structures</h3>

---

## 📘 **Overview**

The **Sorting Tools** project demonstrates classic sorting algorithms and a binary search tree, built using clean, object-oriented C++ design.

It currently includes:

- 🔁 **Bubble Sort**  
- ⚡ **Quick Sort** (using a *median-of-three* pivot strategy)  
- 🌳 **Binary Search Tree (BST)** — with insertion and in-order traversal for sorted output  

---

## 🧠 **What It Can Do**

- 🎲 Generate random integer datasets  
- 🧩 Sort data using different algorithms  
- 🌳 Store and traverse data using a Binary Tree  
- 💾 Save results to a file with `fstream`  
- 🧱 Serve as a foundation for adding new algorithms or data structures  

---

## ⚙️ **Features**

- 🧱 **Object-Oriented Architecture**  
  Clean, modular C++ class design that makes it easy to expand and maintain.  

- 🎲 **Random Data Generator**  
  Automatically creates test datasets for sorting and tree operations.  

- 🔁 **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**  
  Includes both **Bubble Sort** and **Quick Sort** with a **median-of-three** pivot strategy for efficiency.  

- 🌳 **Binary Search Tree Integration**  
  Insert, traverse, and sort elements through a tree-based structure.  

- 💾 **File Output Support**  
  Save generated or sorted data directly to files using `fstream`.  

- 🧩 **Extensible Framework**  
  Easily add new sorting algorithms or data structures without changing existing code.  

- 📈 **Performance-Ready Foundation**  
  Designed for benchmarking, experimentation, and algorithm comparisons.  

---

## 🌱 **Future Improvements**

- 🧮 Add **Merge Sort** and **Heap Sort** implementations  
- 📊 Include **performance comparison** between algorithms  
- 🖥️ Add a **CLI menu** for algorithm selection  
- 🧷 Extend the **Binary Tree** into a **Balanced BST** (AVL or Red-Black Tree)
