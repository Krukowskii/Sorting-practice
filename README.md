🧮 Sorting Tools

A simple C++ project demonstrating sorting algorithms and data structures using an object-oriented approach.

📖 Overview

The SortingTools class provides implementations of:

Bubble Sort

Quick Sort (with median-of-three pivot selection)

Binary Search Tree (BST) — supports insertion, traversal, and optional sorting via in-order traversal

It can:

Generate random integer data

Sort it using different algorithms

Store and traverse data using a Binary Tree

Save results to a file

⚙️ Features

✅ Object-oriented design (C++ class)
✅ Random data generation
✅ Bubble Sort and Quick Sort
✅ Binary Search Tree implementation
✅ File output via fstream
✅ Easy to extend with new algorithms and data structures
